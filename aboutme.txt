I'm a Full-Stack Developer specializing in modern web applications with React, Next.js, and Node.js. Currently serving as a sponsored open source maintainer at Epicenter (YC S25).

What I bring:
→ 2+ years building production applications for startups
→ Experience with AI integration (OpenAI, Claude APIs)
→ Strong foundation in both frontend and backend development 
→ Track record of shipping features from design to deployment

My technical journey:
I started coding after high school on my phone, building a Google search clone out of curiosity. That early passion led me through Harvard's CS50, 100+ algorithm problems, and dozens of real-world projects.

Recent highlights:
→ Selected as sponsored maintainer for YC-backed productivity platform
→ Built conversational AI platform with real-time chat and payments
→ Enhanced video call systems, improving connection stability by 30%
→ Active contributor to developer community (300+ code reviews on Frontend Mentor)

I'm passionate about clean code, great user experiences, and helping teams ship better software faster.

Currently exploring opportunities in full-stack development where I can contribute to meaningful products and grow with innovative teams.
